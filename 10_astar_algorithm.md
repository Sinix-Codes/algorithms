#### ðŸ“… Discovered Date: 1968
#### ðŸ“ƒ Detailed Description
The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is widely used due to its performance and accuracy. A* uses a heuristic to determine the best path from a start node to a goal node by considering both the distance from the start and the estimated distance to the goal.

* ðŸ”¹ Algorithm Steps:
- Initialize an open list and a closed list.
- Add the starting node to the open list.
- Repeat until the goal is found:
- Remove the node with the lowest cost from the open list.
- Add it to the closed list.
- Generate its neighbors.
- If a neighbor is the goal, stop the search.
- Else, calculate the total cost for the neighbor and add it to the open list.
- Return the path found.
* ðŸ”¹ Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(E) where E is the number of edges.
Space Complexity: O(V).
